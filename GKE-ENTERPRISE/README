GKE Standard vs. GKE Enterprise
ðŸ”¹ GKE Standard

The default managed Kubernetes service in Google Cloud.

You get:

Managed control plane (Google runs & upgrades it).

You manage node pools (VMs under the hood).

Cluster lifecycle automation (create, upgrade, scale).

Built-in integrations with logging, monitoring, IAM.

Pricing: You pay for control plane + nodes (VMs).

Best for teams/projects that just need Kubernetes clusters with basic GCP integrations.

ðŸ”¹ GKE Enterprise

Built on top of GKE Standard, but adds enterprise-grade features for multi-cluster, multi-project, and multi-team setups.

Includes GKE Enterprise edition of Anthos (integrated management + security).

Key Benefits:

1. Fleet Management (Multi-cluster / Multi-project)

You can register multiple clusters into a Fleet (even across projects).

Single-pane-of-glass for cluster + workload visibility.

Policies, configs, and RBAC can be applied fleet-wide.

2. Centralized Policy & Config Management

Config Sync â†’ Apply GitOps-style configs to multiple clusters.

Policy Controller â†’ Enforce security/compliance guardrails across clusters.

3. Service Mesh (Istio-based, fully managed)

Out-of-the-box secure service-to-service communication with mTLS, traffic policies, observability.

Easier zero-trust networking for enterprises.

4. Workload Security & Governance

Binary Authorization â†’ Ensure only trusted/container-scanned images run.

Workload Identity Federation â†’ Strong identity integration with IAM.

Built-in vulnerability scanning & compliance checks.

5. Multi-environment & Hybrid Flexibility

Manage on-prem clusters, other cloud clusters, or GKE clusters â†’ all under one umbrella.

Useful if your org is hybrid or multi-cloud.

6. Enterprise Support & SLAs

99.95% SLA for multi-zonal + enterprise-grade Google Cloud support.

What is Config Sync?

A GitOps tool in GKE Enterprise that continuously syncs your Kubernetes configs from a Git repo into one or many clusters.

You donâ€™t kubectl apply manually â†’ you just commit YAML to Git, and Config Sync applies it across your fleet.

Policy Controller is a gatekeeper for your clusters.

It lets you define rules (policies) about what can and cannot be deployed.

It enforces security, compliance, and best practices across your GKE clusters.

It is built on Open Policy Agent (OPA) Gatekeeper but comes pre-integrated with GKE Enterprise.

Example Use Cases

Security:

Pods cannot run as root.

Only signed container images are allowed.

Enforce resource limits (CPU/memory).

Governance:

All resources must have a team: label.

Only certain namespaces can be created.

Compliance:

Must use specific storage classes.

Restrict images to private registries only.

Policy constraints: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/enterprise/policy-controller/docs/latest/reference/constraint-template-library#k8sreplicalimits

If you enable pod related customize fleet setitngs in feature manager in GKE Enterprise, it will restrict few options like security context.

Baseline â†’ donâ€™t run dangerous pods.

Restricted â†’ force pods to be strictly secure.

Policy Essentials â†’ enforce extra company rules (labels, image sources, resource limits).
