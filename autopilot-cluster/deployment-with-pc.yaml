# Feature	Job (Single-use) ðŸš¦	Deployment (Consistent) ðŸ”„
# Placeholder lifespan	Ends after completion/eviction	Always recreated
# Capacity available	Only during Job window	Always (persistent overhead)
# Best use case	Short bursts, known time	Continuous buffer for unpredictable workloads
# After workload later	May wait for new nodes	Immediate scheduling
